# FlexBoxLandingPage

This is a mini project that is part of an exercise from the Odin Project. For this project, I will be using the skills that I have learnt from the Odion Project Content and apply it on this mini project. This project isn't complicated as I have created a simple web page based on Matrix Trilogy which is one of my favorite movie franchise.
